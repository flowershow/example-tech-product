## Why 404Shield?

### Instant Error Eradication

Our script intercepts 404 errors before they ever reach your visitors.

### Redirect to Random Meme
Because if you can’t find the page, at least make them laugh.

### Smart Redirects
Guess the intended page using our AI (Actually Imaginary) engine.

### Eternal Uptime
If every page exists, then none are ever missing. Think about it.

## How It Works

Just install one script on your site. That’s it.  
We’ll take care of the rest by pretending every URL is valid.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.404shield.fake/autoFix.js"></script>
```

Optional config:

```js
window._404Shield = {
  redirectTo: "https://random.meme",
};
```
